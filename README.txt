  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
         YOU MUST REMOVE ANY PREVIOUS VERSIONS BEFORE INSTALLATION
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  HOW TO PLAY:
  ============

  Start  Phire  by  tapping  on the  application icon  in the  application
  launcher.  After a  short while,  you will  be presented  with the  main  
  Parashoot  screen in which  you may select the type of game  you wish to 
  play, or setup any configuration options.

  There are two types of game play available,  game A and B -  your choice
  depends  solely on  your confidence  and  skill  level.  Game A  is  for 
  beginners, where Game B requires more skill and  co-ordination.  You can
  select the game type by tapping on the "Game A" or "Game B" buttons,  or
  by using a menu command.

  Using the  hard keys  or the stylus,  you must  position the  trampoline 
  correctly  and rescue  as many survivors as you can that have jumped out 
  from the burning building. You  may configure the  key and sound  volume 
  in the configuration screen.  You get to this by selecting the menu item 
  'Config'  in  the 'Game' menu.  Consult your handheld  device manual for 
  instructions of selecting a menu item.  When a  game is active,  you may 
  tap  the speaker icon at  the bottom left  of  the screen to  get to the
  configuration  screen.  It  is  possible to  pause the  current  game in 
  progress by tapping the paw icon.

  REGISTRATION:
  =============
  
  Phire is shareware, the demonstration version does not allow the  player 
  to generate  high  score codes  or the  ability to  save  more  than  50  
  survivors. To access these features,  a device  identification number is
  required to generate a unique unlocking registration datafile.

  You can get to the registration screen by  selecting the 'Register' menu 
  item in the 'Game' menu.  It is very  important to ensure  that you copy 
  down the device identification exactly as it is presented in this dialog
  as follows:

   45:6D:75:6C:61:74:6F:72:39 <--- generated from the "Emulator" username

  It is  very common that users copy down this information incorrectly and
  hence delay the registration process. An exact match is required for the
  restration process to succeed.

  REGISTRATION IS FREE - however, you will be required to fill in a survey
  asking for minimal information about your Palm Computing Platform  usage
  at the following web address:

   http://www.ardiri.com/index.cfm?redir=palm&cat=phire&subcat=survey

  Payments (donations of $5US) are accepted ONLY at PalmGearHQ and are not
  refundable. Donations support future developments and the developer.  if 
  you paid for this software in another manner - you have been ripped off.
  report any occurances by sending an email to aaron@ardiri.com

  To be included the the  global high score table (http://www.ardiri.com),
  send an  email to aaron@ardiri. com with  the information  shown  in the 
  'Register Your Score'  dialog.  This will  only appear  if you  beat the 
  internal high  score for each game type,  or if you request it using the
  menu option under the 'Score' menu on the main page.

  Thankyou for downloading and playing Phire!
